# OSU Coding Bootcamp Assignment 1: Code Refactor

Client request was to refactor their main page html code to be more accessible using semantic tags. Improvements were also made to the index.html doc by organizing and commenting the code. Additional changes were made to the style.css document to condense similar styling structures and reorganize the code so it follows the flow of the html document. Comments were also added to the style.css document to make it more understandable.

## Lessons Learned

This assignment provided the oportunity to start understanding the syntax of both HTML and CSS. It also taught me a lot about semantic elements and why they are used. A major lesson learned in this assignment was the importance of checking your work as go. At one point during this assignment I had thought I finished a major section only to check how it looked live and see that the whole page was a jumble and needing to go back through and figure out where I had gone wrong. Had I took the time to check on what my changes were doing I could have saved myself a lot time. Another lesson learned was the use og Git for the project and the aspect of deployment. This took me a little while to understand, but all I needed was a little patience to let the files deploy completely.
